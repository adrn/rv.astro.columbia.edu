Scott participated in Columbia’s Science Research Program the past two summers and worked in a physics lab. There he fabricated microchips and suspended carbon nanotubes across the microhips' electrodes.  He loves teaching the students about earth science and astronomy and is looking forward to enhancing his school’s astronomy lessons with a data-collecting telescope.<p>
Outside of work Scott loves all sports.  He plays in softball and basketball leagues and is currently training for the NYC Marathon.    He is also taking guitar lessons in his spare time.

After five years in the aerospace industry, he moved to NYC for grad school and to pursue his calling as an educator.  Currently in his fourth year at Flushing International High School, he teaches ESL Living Environment and rotating science electives,  and is a co-founder of the school Science Club. <p>
An alumnus of the Columbia SRP, he spent two summers investigating membrane polarity in yeast cells with the Fred Chang lab.  He looks forward to the Rooftop Variables program as an ideal opportunity to continue sharing exciting hands-on science experiences with his students.  When not teaching, he enjoys reading, BBC6 and cooking for his bride and baby daughter.</p></td>

Her research interests are in galaxies, patterns, and instrumentation.  Between college and grad school, she moved to London to go to Le Cordon Bleu culinary school.  She then worked as a chef in her hometown in New Jersey.  She receives an unusually large amount of flack for her love of her home state.</p>
          <p>Erika comes from a family with a long history of teaching, and is excited about the chance to help teachers make science fun for students.  Outside of school, she spends a lot of time cooking, going to the Opera, and visiting New Jersey.</p></td>

        <p>Having started his scientific education with a BA in computer science at Pomona College, and later receiving his MA in astronomy at Wesleyan University, Cameron is now a third-year PhD student at Columbia University.  Cameron's research consists of using computer simulations and observations of the sky in order to better understand how galaxies form and evolve throughout cosmological history.  He is also interested in our nearest neighbor, the Moon, and how it has changed over the last few billion years.</p>
        <p>Cameron loves bringing science to the public through lectures, star-gazing, and outreach activities.  He one day hopes to become an astronaut.  Outside of astronomy, Cameron enjoys running, cycling, hiking, languages, mustard and Guitar Hero.</p></td>

        <p>As for public involvement in Rooftop Variables, I am optimistic about the educational and developmental benefits of this program. It is my hope that such a program can continue to address concerns in the city about the available resources and visibility of higher education programs. This program should serve to give students access to science, and astronomy in particular, that is lacking in the NYC schools and enhance the learning experience of such subjects.</p>

<p>Maria is a 6th year PhD student at Columbia University, working on the  
dynamics of galaxies in clusters. She has a Masters degree in  
Astronomy from the University of Hawaii, and studied physics as an  
undergraduate at Imperial College in London and the University of  
Cambridge. Her thesis work has been mainly theoretical, involving  
large computer simulations of galaxy clusters, but she is also an  
enthusiastic observer, having spent many nights battling scorpions on  
Kitt Peak, staving off frostbite on Mauna Kea, and wrestling with  
kangaroos in the Warrumbungles.

<p>When not fighting for her life on mountain-tops, or struggling with  
the latest code crash on her computer, Maria enjoys the more quiet  
pleasures in life: canoeing in still water, reading Portuguese poetry,  
watching old westerns and writing in really long sentences.
